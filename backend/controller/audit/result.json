I did not read the Bible.  I did not go to church.  I did not think about dying, or heaven or hell.I owned my own business and tried to be a good person.  I thought I had succeeded by my own wits.One evening, my wife and I heard documentation that these were the last days before Jesus Christ would return.  Not wanting to hear it, I almost walked out.  Something kept me there, and I listened, but was not convinced.  I decided to do some research to find out if the Bible was true.Indeed, if I could find one contradiction or anything that was not true, then I could disregard it.  I thought this would be easy.  This led me into much research.  I learned nearly one\u2013third of the Bible is, directly or indirectly, related to prophecy.  I needed to determine when the Bible was written.  Thus, a study of biblical history, translations, and archaeology was necessary.  The Dead Sea Scrolls, which had been found in Israel, contained Old Testament prophecies of the coming of Jesus.  It has been proven that these were written before Christ came.  Thousands of clay tablets and archaeological sites confirmed many accounts in the Bible.I took time off and began studying the prophecies.  My wife spent much time at the library.  She obtained documentation from reference books and various sources, which I would check against the Scriptures to see if the prophecies took place.  I worked on it day and night.  One week went by, and then a month.  No stone was left unturned.  Every prophecy we were able to document proved to be true.  I was astonished, but still not convinced.  Later, people would show me what appeared to be mistakes and contradictions in the Bible.  Turned out, these were not contradictions, but only a lack of research on their part.  Stubborn, that\u2019s me.  Even after four months of intensive study, night and day, authenticating prophecy after prophecy, I was still skeptical.  I became more determined.  It wasn\u2019t possible that the sixty\u2013six books of the Bible, written by many people over hundreds of years, would not have some errors.  Thousands of prophecies, and every one perfect?  No, impossible!  If I would admit that, then I would also have to admit that God in heaven exists, and that I needed to surrender myself to Him.  I was not prepared to do that\u2014yet, I wanted to know the truth.  More months passed.  I still refused to admit the Bible was all true.  I pushed on.  More and more research took place.Unknown to me, before I reached this point, my wife had received Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior, but not me.  I was just too stubborn.  Perhaps, my success in the business world was also blinding me.  Perhaps, it was my refusal to admit I had been wrong all my life.  Perhaps, it was that I just did not want to repent and change.But then, finally, after thousands of hours, I just gave up and stopped.  I had to admit that I was wrong.I became afraid.  I understood that I would perish.  I knew what I had to do to be born again.  I repented and surrendered my life to Jesus Christ.  I got on my knees and prayed.  I received Him as my only hope of salvation by FAITH\u2013ref Eph 2:8\u201310.  Afterward, I was baptized by full immersion.  Jn 3:16\u2013For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Acts 4:12\u2013There is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we MUST be saved.   I may have beenthe biggest skeptic in the world, but now I know\u2014the Bible is true and is the Word of God.  Anyone doing the same research could only come to the same conclusion, if they are honest with themselves.", "YOU canrepentand call on Jesus RIGHT NOWto be YOUR Lord and Savior.  You can pray,\u201cJESUS, HAVE MERCY ON ME A SINNER.\u201dAFTER, you are commanded to bebaptizedby full immersion.  Some mistakenly baptize babies.  A baby can\u2019t repent or believe in Christ.

It becomes an obsession for some; yet, no one has ever succeeded.I know, because I was one.  Some have even resorted to telling lies about the Bible, hoping to cause some to turn from God.  I know this also, as some have contacted me, but when I checked out what they said, I found they were dishonest.  If anyone could prove the Bible was not true, it would probably make the headlines of nearly every major media outlet in the world.THERE ARE APP. 10,385 PROPHECIES IN THE BIBLE.

Nearly all of the final 365 prophecies (or the signs of the times) in the Bible that were to occur \nbefore the Rapture are now in place.  In less than a decade, the Rapture is expected.  It will be followed by the horrible Tribulation.  Yet most of the \nworld\u2019s population is completely oblivious to what is taking place. Most cannot name one of the 365 prophecies.Lk 12:54\u201357\u2013Jesus said: When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.  And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.

Yes.* Will there be a one\u2013world economic system or global economy?  Yes.* Will violence, hostility and senseless killings increase in the world?  Yes, it is happening now, even in schools.* Will alternate lifestyles increase, prosper and become accepted?

However, did you know that no prophecyof the latter years of the last days had any meaning, until one seemingly impossible event took place?  That event was the rebirth of the nation of Israel. Did you know God\u2019s Word indicatesa generation would not pass from Israel\u2019s rebirth(May 14, 1948) till all be fulfilled (which includes the events of the Rapture, Tribulation, Armageddon,Christ\u2019sreturn, and the elect gathered).The Bible gives app. 365 prophecies that would all come togetherafter Israel\u2019s rebirth.  By Israel\u2019s rebirth and the signs,we would knowand understand the times we are in.Many people have been preaching about the latter years of the end times in churches, on radio, TV, the Internet, in books, and magazines.  Some include Billy Graham, Hal Lindsey, John Hagee, Charles Stanley, Jimmy Swaggart, Jack Van Impe, Peter Lalonde, Tim LaHaye, Ed Hindson, Perry Stone, and John Ankerberg.  To those that understand the Bible, these things should be understood.  To those that will not admit they sin and repent, but despise God\u2019s Word, no explanation is possible\u2013ref Dan 12:4, 10; Mt 24:37, 39.It has been said that it isVIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLEfor anyone to make 11 straight predictions, 2000 years into the future.  There is only 1 chance in 8 x 10 to the 63rd power, or 80 with 63 zeros after it that such a thing could be done.

Include the rebirth of a specific nation and how it would be reborn.  Include specific nations that would exist and be allied together, and the exact size of a nation\u2019s army.  Include what the people and church would be like in those days.  Do eleven straight prophecies and be perfect on every one.  The Bible not only does this eleven times, but hundreds of times.  If this is so, then even the most skeptical person (that is truthful) would have to agree that God does exist, and the BibleHAS TO BE His Word.It is written:KNOWING THISFIRST, THAT NO PROPHECY OF THE SCRIPTURE IS OF ANY PRIVATE INTERPRETATION.

The Jewish people would be scattered worldwide; yet the Bible predicted that \u201cIsrael would become a nation\u201d again.  It would happen after a long time and at a time the Bible calls the \u201clatter days\u201d\u2013ref Isa 66:8; Mic 5:3; Ezek 38:8.Against what appeared to beimpossible odds, this prophecy was fulfilled onMay 14, 1948, after about 2500 years had passed.That\u2019s 1 out of 1.  Immediately, the combined powers of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt attacked seeking to destroy them.  Israel had no chance.  They had little to defend themselves against even one nation, let alone 5.  Yet God was with them.  They prevailed.  Prophecy fulfilled.Israel\u2019s rebirth was theKEY SIGNthat began thegenerationthat would witness over 360 prophecies come to pass.  As already stated, this generation would end with the events called the Rapture, the Tribulation, the Battle of Armageddon, return of Christ, and gathering of the elect.That generation should not exceed 70 to 80 years\u2013ref Ps 90:10.The Bible foretold that most people would not be aware of what the Bible said regarding the signs of the times, including the church. It would be like Noah\u2019s day, when few understood a flood was coming, and they would die.  The Bible foretold ofmockers that would not be saved\u2013Jude18.(Prophecy 2).  Israel shall be brought forth \u201cin one day, at once\u201d\u2013ref Isa 66:8.  Prophecy fulfilled May 14, 1948.  On Nov. 29, 1947, the General Assembly of the U.N. approved a resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.  On the morning of May 14, 1948 (the last day of the British mandate), a meeting of the People\u2019s Council took place in Israel to decide on the name and finalize the Declaration.  At precisely 4pm, the proclamation ceremony began at the Tel Aviv Museum.  The 979 Hebrew words of the Scroll of Independence were read.  All stood, and the scroll was adopted.  The notorious White Paper, issued by the British in 1930, restricting Jewish immigration, was declared null and void.  The People\u2019s Council signed the proclamation.  David Ben\u2013Gurion rapped his gavel, declaring, \u201cThe State of Israel is established.  This meeting is ended.\u201dIn one day, at once, EXACTLY as the Bible predicted\u2014Israel was reborn.  President Truman was swift in announcing U.S. recognition of Israel.  It is written: Isa 66:8\u2013WHO HAS EVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING?  WHO HAS EVER SEEN SUCH THINGS?  CAN A COUNTRY BE BORNIN A DAYOR A NATION BE BROUGHTFORTH IN A MOMENT?  YET NO SOONER IS ZION IN LABOR THAN SHE GIVES BIRTH TO HER CHILDREN.That\u2019s 2 out of 2.(Prophecy 3).  Israel would be (reborn) \u201cout of the nations\u201d\u2013ref Ezek 38:8, 12.  The \u201cUnited Nations\u201d approved a resolution for a Jewish state in Palestine.  For centuries, Israel\u2019s land had been occupied by many nations.In addition, the children of Israel have returned to Israel from nations all over the world.  Prophecy fulfilled.That\u2019s 3 out of 3.(Prophecy 4).  Israel must \u201cregain the city of Jerusalem\u201d\u2013Joel 2:32; Isa 28:14; Ezek 22:19.  This happened in 1967.  By Israel\u2019s rebirth and aprecise line of events that all come together, we would understand the times we are in.  We are not setting a precise date, but there isNO DOUBTthat we are in the generation in which the Rapture will occur.  This should be explained after the signs of the times.  A person\u2019s life on earth is temporary.  Everyone will live forever, but will it be with God, or in the lake of fire?That\u2019s 4 out of 4.(Prophecy 5).  The lastChristian church agebefore the Rapturewould be lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot.  Spiritually, it would beasleep.  God will spew them out.  The Bible tells of today\u2019s church\u2014you have acquired wealth, but your true condition is wretched, miserable, poor,blind, andnaked, andYOU DON\u2019T KNOW IT\u2013Rev 3:14\u201322.  Little Scripture is used anymore that drives a person to their knees in repentance because of sin.  Jesus and the Apostles taught sound doctrine, which included baptism by full immersion following repentance.    They also taught prophecy, conforming to Christ, denying oneself, fearing God, following Christ, forsaking all, hell, obeying God\u2019s Word, serving God, sin, the judgments, the lake of fire, the signs of the times, and the Revelation.Most churchgoers know little of these subjects.  They often know more about their preacher, his family, and church functions than about God\u2019s Word.  Some churches are entertainment, socializing, and sports centers.\n\nFew recognize the miserable, spiritual condition of today\u2019s churches.  In nearly every Christian church today, the Word of God is standing outside knocking on their door, but their door is shut to being corrected and repenting.\nMany Bible universities, famous ministers, and television evangelists think this is the best church age ever, because they have vast outreaches; however, what they teach is wretched, when compared with the teachings of Christ.That\u2019s 5 out of 5.The Bible gives about 119 descriptions of the people of the latter days.  These fit the people of today perfectly,but they did not fit those of 50 or 100 years ago.  Here are some.(Prophecy 6).  Some woulddepart from the faith and go intodevil worship\u20131 Tim 4:1. This is perfect.That\u2019s 6 out of 6.(Prophecy 7).  People wouldmock about the latter days of the last days and would not believe\u20132 Pe 3:3; Jude 18. Are you one of them?That\u2019s 7 out of 7.(Prophecy 8).  People (or we may say children) would bedisobeying their parents\u20132 Tim 3:1,2.  Many parents can verify this is very true.  Was it true 50 years ago?  Not nearly as much.That\u2019s 8 out of 8.(Prophecy 9).  What we callalternate lifestyles would increase and prosper\u2013Lk 17:28,30; Gen 19:5; Ro 1:24,26,27.  As little as 25 years ago, alternate lifestyles were rare.  Now, it is as common as some of your neighbors. That's 9 out of 9.(Prophecy 10).  People would bewithout self\u2013control in sex\u20132 Tim 3:1,2,6; Rev 9:21; Lk 17:28,30; Jude 7.  It is rare for newlyweds to both be virgins anymore.  Reportedly, 75% of all men cheat on their wives, and 65% of wives also cheat.  Multiple sex partners are common.  Some just live together in sin.  How could the Bible have named an exact time (the last church age) \u201c2000 years in the future\u201d and been correct on this?That\u2019s 10 out of 10.(Prophecy 11).  People wouldlove pleasures more than God\u20132 Tim 3:1,2,4.  Picnics, football, soccer, or sleep comes first.  Church?\u2014we can go later, or perhaps not at all.  The American motto, \u201cIn God we trust,\u201d has become a joke.  Remember, these were predicted as part of the signs that we were at the time of the end.That's 11 out of 11.We have just reached the point that seemed impossible.  There was only one chance in 80 with 63 zeros that anyone could write 11 straight predictions, 2000 years into the future, and be perfect on everyone.  If such a set of predictions did exist,it would have to be the Word of God.  Yet, there is more!(Prophecy 12).  People would betaking drugs\u2013Rev 9:21.  The Greek word for sorceries, in Rev 9:21, refers to pharmaceuticals or drugs.  Many will try most anything to get \u201ca high.\u201d  Some drugs have now become legal.  God\u2019s Word is 100% right on every one.That\u2019s 12 out of 12.  How could you have any doubts at this point?\nCan you find a movie anymore that does not curse God\u2019s name?  Does anyone fear God anymore?  Gum chewing was a problem in schools in the 1940\u2019s.  Today, it\u2019s stealing, weapons, and drugs.  It\u2019s going to getworse.  The Bible is never wrong.(Prophecy 13).  There would beweapons that could destroy the world\u2013Mk 13:20;Rev 6:8; Rev 9:18; Zech 14:8,12. Incredibly, this prophecy was written in the days of swords, spears and arrows.That\u2019s 13 out of 13.It is estimated that the nuclear arsenals of the USA and Russia (as of now) could kill every living thing on earth 6 times over.  Russia and the USA both have bombs that are 2500x more powerful than those used against Japan.  They have delivery systems that could strike the other in 8 to 15 minutes.Consider, 2000 years ago, people thought the earth was flat, yet the Bible tells us it is round\u2013ref Isa 40:22.  People had crazy ideas about what held the earth up, even though the Bible says it hangs upon nothing\u2013Job 26:7.  People were wrong.  The Bible was right.(Prophecy 14).  In the latter days, when Israel was again a nation, there would bea great military power to its extreme north in the land of Magog(which is modern Russia)\u2013Ezek 38:2\u20134,8,15,16.  Moscow is almost directly north of Israel.Incredible!How could the Bible have foretold the location of a nation, facts about its military, and the time period it would happen?  Russia is one of the two great military powers in the world.That\u2019s 14 out of 14.As already said: Lk 24:25\u2013O FOOLS, AND SLOW OF HEART TO BELIEVE ALL THAT THE PROPHETS HAVE SPOKEN.  We are listing only a few of the 365 prophecies that are expected to be fulfilled before the Rapture and Tribulation happen\u2014363 are now in place.(Prophecy 15).  There would be anation to the far east of Israel, to the end of the earth.They would have anarmy of 200 million.  How could the Bible, 2000 years ago, have foretold the time period and location of a specific nation and  the size of its military?  It is estimated, at the time this prophecy was given, the world\u2019s population was only about this same figure.  China has boasted that they could field an army of this \u201cexact\u201d figure.  That\u2019s 15 perfectly fulfilled prophecies in a row.  The Bible is true.  Here are two additional ones.(Prophecy 16).  Violence would increase.  Have you noted the violence now going on in the Middle East?  Women are kidnapped, raped and sold.  People are beheaded.  Violence has jumped all over the world, even in schools.  This was not true 35 years ago.That\u2019s 16 out of 16.  The time of the end is at hand.  How much proof do you need to have?(Prophecy 17).  A KEY PROPHECY.There would be aneconomic alliance of the nations of the Old Roman Empire.  This is a description of the European Union today (the EU).  It has adopted a one\u2013currency system for many of its nations.  It is written, IN THE DAYS OF THESE KINGS (these nations, which isNOW) SHALL THE GOD OF HEAVEN SET UP A KINGDOM\u2013Dan 2:44.That\u2019s 17 out of 17.We have now \u201cgone past\u201d the point that seemed impossible, which was 11 perfect predictions.  The Rapture will happensoon.  The Tribulation will follow.Even the biggest skeptic should see the Bible is true(if they are honest).  God does exist, and the Bible is His Word, andwe have proved it.  Study the Gospel daily, and obey it.  God loves you.  He really does.Mt 16:26\u2013WHAT IS A MAN PROFITED, IF HE SHALL GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD, AND LOSE HIS OWN SOUL?\n  You can cry out to Jesus right now by praying, HAVE MERCY ON ME, O LORD, THOU SON OF DAVID\u2013Mt 15:22.  Turn from sin to Jesus.  Then be baptized by immersion.  When Jesus comes to catch away His people, many will realize it is about to happen.  However, it will be too late to repent.  If you are waiting for the last HOUR to surrender to Christ\u2014that HOUR IS NOW.", "What\u2019s Next?The Rapture Followed By the Tribulation(Why Most Will Be Left Behind)", "RAPTUREis a term used to describe the removal from the earth of all that are born\u2013again, as evidenced by theirrepentance, love, following Jesus, and obedience to God\u2019s Word.  \u201cFew fit this description.\u201dThe key is devouring God\u2019s Word daily andletting It change you.  Excuses do not lead to heaven.  A sinner\u2019s prayer, without repentance and obeying God\u2019s Word afterwards, means nothing.  What is written?Repentand bebaptizedevery one of you\u2013Acts 2:38.The Rapture ends the church age.  The Tribulation begins soon after.  Do not be deceived.  The Revelation portrays the rapturedsaints in heaven, before the throne of God, prior to the Antichrist coming forth.  1 Cor 15:51,52\u2013\u201cWe shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment in the twinkling of an eye, at the last (that is, thesecond) trump: for the trumpet shall sound.\u201d  1 Thes 4:16,17\u2013\u201cand the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds.\u201d  Born again Christians will be with Jesus.  All others will face the dreadful Tribulation.  The number of people that will be raptured will bevery small.Mostthat believe they will be raptured will be left behind\u2013ref Mt 7:13,14, 21\u201323; 20:16; 25:8\u201311.  People in some churches never hear the words \u201cRapture\u201d or \u201cthe signs of the times.\u201d  Find a church that does teach these.Beware: The Scriptures clearly reveal that in these latter days, \u201cmany\u201d Bible teachers are deceivers, who confess not thatJesus Christ is come in the flesh.  Some are famous and have large outreaches on the airwaves.  They deceive many with their ideas that are contrary to good, sound Bible doctrine.  Those that listen to them are not aware of them.  The Bible tells us that this is the age of religious deception, when people will not put up with sound doctrine, but they will gather around themselves teachers that will say what their (worldly and) itching ears desire to hear.  If you are one of them, you need to repent.Some maywrongly believethe Bible teaches no man can know the day and hour of the Rapture.THIS IS NOT CORRECT.  It is true,those not readywill not know or understand; however, those watching and ready will know.  It is written\u20131 Thes 5:4-BUT YE,BRETHREN, ARE NOT IN DARKNESS, THAT THAT DAY SHOULD OVERTAKE YOU AS A THIEF.  Born again Christianscan knowthrough the signs of the time.Manymisread the \u201cday and hour\u201d verseby disregarding the verse right before it.  It is written: Mt 24:35,36\u2013\u201cHEAVEN AND EARTH SHALL PASS AWAY,\u201d BUT MY WORDS SHALL NOT PASS AWAY. BUT OF\u201cTHAT\u201d DAY AND HOUR KNOWETH NO MAN(the day and hour of the heaven and earth passing away, no man knows), NO, NOT THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN, BUT MY FATHER ONLY.The Scriptures speak of 7 Jewish feast days.  TheFeast of Trumpetsis the next one to be fulfilled.Two trumpetsare blown\u2014the first one and the last one.  This is usually in September.  This is the day the Rapture is expected to come.  It will bewithin a generation of the rebirth of Israel.  That generation began May 14, 1948 and could continue to as late as 2028\u2013ref Ps 90:10.  When one subtracts the Tribulation period, one can see clearly that the Rapture of God\u2019s people is very close.  The hour it will come isat midnight(Israeli time)\u2013Mt 25:6. As it is written, AT MIDNIGHT THERE WAS A CRY MADE.  BEHOLD THE BRIDEGROOM COMETH.  If it would come this year, would you be ready?After the Rapture, thespirit of lawlessnesswill be unleashed.  Sin, hate, and every kind of evil can be expected to explode as never before throughout the world.

They were not doers of God\u2019s Word; yet, many thought they were saved.  In some cases, their Bibles were rarely read.  They never understood about making a covenant with Christ by sacrifice\u2013Ps 50:5.  Excuses and unbelief will abide with many that are not taken.  They may have sung a song that said, \u201cI surrender all,\u201d but they never did.  Many may have thought that only saying a prayer would save them, asmany famous preachers said.  Yet their Bibles would show this was not correct.Immediately following the Rapture, the spirit of lawlessness will be let loose.  Violence worldwide will increase and begin approaching the way it was before the flood.Immediatelyfollowing the Rapture, the man of sin (called Antichrist, and many other names) comes forth-2 Thes 2:6\u201312.  He assumes control of the EU.  He will be brilliant, charismatic and have an unusual, almost hypnotic, power of persuasion.  He confirms a covenant (or agreement, or treaty) with Israel and others,WHICH BEGINS THE TRIBULATION\u2013ref Dan 9:27.He is the son of Satan.  God warns Israel, in His Word, that their agreement with hell would not stand.  Israel does not heed His warning.Immediatelyfollowing the Rapture,144,000 male, virgin Jews are sealedwith the seal of the living God on their foreheads.  This seal will protect them.  Twelve thousand are sealed from each of the tribes of Israel.  None are sealed from the tribe of Dan.(Those days should be shortened.  The Lord had shortened those days.  He hath shortened the days.  He will cut it short.  A short work {or a shortened Tribulation} will the Lord make.)The entire Tribulation is a 7 year period of 360 days each, which is also 2520 days, or 84 months of 30 days each.  It consists of two equal periods of 3\u00bd years, which is two 42 month periods, or two 1260 day periods.  The event that separates them is called the Abomination of Desolation (which is explained further on).  However, the Lord may have cut shortthe first3\u00bd years\u2013ref Mk 13:20; Ro 9:28, and others.  This will happen for the elect\u2019s sake,which are Jews.  If the Lord had not shortened the days of the Tribulation, no flesh (or life) would be saved (or would survive).  Most Jewsmay not understandthis, until certain events happen sooner than expected.  Few, if any Gentiles, may comprehend this now, or later.This is whythe elect must look for the Abomination to occur, rather than counting 1260 days from the covenant of Dan 9:27.  This should be explained underTribulation Shortened.Day one of the Tribulationoccurs when the Antichrist confirms a covenant (or agreement) with Israel and others for 7 years.  There are no adequate words to describe how bad the Tribulation will be. The first part will be terrifying.  The second part will be even worse.", "(Russia and Its Allies Attack Israel)", "Not long after the Rapture, God will bring Russia forth against Israel.  Iran and others will come also.Russia attacks Israel to carry away silver, gold, and food, and to take a great spoil.This indicates they will be hurting for food and finances.  Are there any signs that this is beginning to happen now?  Tiny Israel, despite its military advances, will have no chance.  But, then,God steps in and makes His presence known.  He destroys nearly all the invadersin such a way that the world will recognize Jesus Christ is alive and is protecting Israel\u2013Ez 38,39.The destruction of the invading armies will start with an earthquake.  The invaders will go into a state of confusion and turn their weapons on each other.  A plague and sickness will strike them.  Heavy rains will come.  Huge hailstones will rain down on them.  Burning coals of sulfur will also come down.  Only one\u2013sixth of the Russian invaders will be left alive.  The birds and wild animals will have a great feast.  God will be glorified as a result.  Those that plunder Israel will become plunder for Israel.  The dead bodies will be buried for seven months.  Then men will search for more bones.", "(World War 3)", "The USA becomes involved, but at what point is unclear.  The destruction of thelandof Russia (or Magog) and theUSAfollows.  God will send fire upon both nations.  The massive destruction will come from aircraft, missiles, and satellites of the opposing nation.  The battle will take 4 hours of the day and 4 hours of the night.  Thick clouds will cover one\u2013third of the earth.  The fiery red horse will have been unleashed.Are there any problems developing between the USA and Russia right now?  Is much of the world turning against Israel, even though, in 1948, much of the world was \u201cfor\u201d Israel?If you claim to be born again, but do not love God\u2019s people, the Jews, you should examine yourself by God\u2019s Word and repent.", "(Results of World War 3)", "One\u2013fourth of the world\u2019s population will ultimately die.  The nearly two billion people that will die will have hadno chance to repent, as this happens soon after the Rapture.  Therefore,ALL perish to hell\u2013ref Rev 6:8.Hell followed all that died.  As a result of the Russian\u2013USA exchange, one\u2013third of trees will be burned up.  All green grass worldwide will be burned up, as the radio active fallout follows the wind currents.  This includesfarm crops.  One\u2013third of the waters will become wormwood (or poisoned, or radioactive, or bitter).  One\u2013third of the sea will become blood.  One\u2013third of the creatures in the sea will die\u2014thus, a shortage of fish.  One\u2013third of the ships will be destroyed.  Few ever thought this war would happen.  From this point on,much of the USA and Russia can be expected to be a radioactive pile of ash.  They will no longer be on the world scene.  The USA will be as a tree that is reduced to astump.  Few are left alive.  The dead bodies will become food for the wild animals and birds.  The USA has turned their back on God.  The preaching has become watered\u2013down.  Nearly every perverse sin imaginable has become acceptable.  Thus, God\u2019s judgment will come.How often do you fast unto the Lord\u2014perhaps for a week each year?  Do you ever fast even for a day?  Do you tithe?  God\u2019s people that understand His Word do.  The Bible teachesFEWgo to heaven.  Did you ever hear a clergy say any deceased person went to hell?

None that are involved with this institution will be raptured, including the priests and pope.  This church has its roots back to the Babylonian cult, which claimed to possess the highest wisdom.  Before a member could be initiated, he had to \u201cconfess\u201d to the priest.  The priest then had him in his power.  Once admitted into this order, men were no longer Babylonians, Assyrians, or Egyptians, but members of a Mystical Brotherhood over which was placed a Pontiff or \u201cHigh Priest,\u201d whose word was law.  When Attalus died in B.C. 133, he bequeathed the headship of this \u201cBabylonian Priesthood\u201d to Rome.  Astrology is part of this church.  It is headquartered in a small, independent area of Rome called the Vatican.  It has an almost hypnotic hold on many people.It may be said that the heart of this church is seductiveness, deception, manipulation, domination, and control.  To many, she is the way to heaven, but, in reality, her people are all bound for hell, not the unbiblical purgatory.  On the outside, she looks beautiful; but on the inside, she is an abomination.  \u201cJezebel\u201d (Rev 2:20) is synonymous with the Roman Catholic Church in the Revelation.

This enables the Kings of the East to cross over it in the latter part of the Tribulation, as they come to Israel.)(Note: Whether the rain being shut off is only in Israel and the Middle East, including the Euphrates, is not known.  Scripture does not seem to indicate the whole world will have no rain.)Some wondered if Enoch will be one of the two.  He was not a Jew.  At Passover, children are taught to expect Elijah to come before the dreadful Day of the Lord (which is Armageddon).The two witnesses will speak such things as: THE VOICE OF HIM THAT CRIETH IN THE WILDERNESS,PREPARE YE THE WAY OF THE LORD.  Also BEHOLD, I WILL SEND MY MESSENGER, AND HE SHALL PREPARE THE WAY BEFORE ME: AND THE LORD, WHOM YE SEEK,SHALL SUDDENLY COME TO HIS TEMPLE.  They will warn the people against taking the mark and worshipping the image.  It is an unforgivable sin.  They will preach the Gospel of the Kingdom\u2014that is, the 1000 year reign of Christ.  All the world will see that their power is greater than that of the Antichrist; yet, most will not heed their warnings.  They will turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the children to their fathers.", "(The Antichrist is Killed But Comes Back to Life)", "About the same time as the two witnesses appear, theANTICHRIST(also called the Beast) is killed by a wound in the head from a weapon.   The world can see it on their handheld devices and the TV.  But then the impossible happens.  His deadly wound will be healed.  As the Antichrist comes back to life, a spirit will come up from the bottomless pit to occupy his body.  That spirit was once alive, but then dead, and now is alive again in the Antichrist.  The world is astonished.He declares himself to be Godand moves into the rebuilt temple in Jerusalem.  Thedaily sacrificeis taken away.  They ascribe to him deity.  People say such things as, \u201cWho is like the beast?\u201d which is the Antichrist, and \u201cWho is able to make war against him? Who is able to kill him?\u201d Satan gives his son power, his seat, and great authority.The Antichrist will exalt himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped.  He will sit in the temple of God showing himself that he is God.  He has no regard for the God of his fathers, which is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He honors the god of forces, which is Satan, with gold, silver, precious stones and costly gifts.  He glorifies the Devil (which is also called the Dragon in the Scriptures).", "(The World Changes Greatly After the Antichrist Comes Back to Life)", "TheANTICHRISTis quick to sieze, as strong as a bear, and has the pride of a lion.  He will do great miracles and wonders, so that, if it were possible, he could deceive even the very elect of God.  His power will be as a result of Satan.  The world will be persuaded that this is god, and he speaks the truth.  He causes craft or deceit to prosper.  He has no desire for women.  He will change the set times and the laws.  The various feast days of the past can be expected to be erased.  He will have power over all people and every nation.  He will accuse the God of heaven of things that have never been heard.  He slanders His name, His tabernacle, and those that dwell in heaven.  No person, or ruler on earth, has any power or authority to stand against him.

Jesus had said in return: Mt 4:10\u2013GET THEE HENCE, SATAN: FOR IT IS WRITTEN, THOU SHALT WORSHIP THE LORD THY GOD, AND HIM ONLY SHALT THOU SERVE.  However, the Antichrist accepts this offer.

However, the second part of the Tribulationwill begin earlier than expected, as the Lord will shorten the first part for the elect\u2019s sake.  Note: This is why the elect have to watch for the \u201cAbomination\u201d to take place, and then flee for their lives.  They could not count 1260 days from the covenant, and then flee.  Most Jews should understand this, as that day approaches.  Most Gentiles may not.  The first part being cut has to do with the elect Jews, not the Gentiles.  Let it be stated this way.

If she goes to get her child, both of them will be caught, tortured, and killed.  A father has a thought to get a jacket, so he hesitates and gets caught.  The obedient will escape.  If a person is caught, the full wrath of Satan will be poured out against them, unless they take the mark and worship the image.As the Jews that are trusting in Jesus flee for their lives with God\u2019s help, Satan tries to stop them with a flood, but the earth opens its mouth and swallows the water, and they escape.  God will take care of them for the next 3 \u00bd years.  Satan is wroth that the elect Jews escaped.

A girl will be sold for wine, so they can drink.THE THIRD OF THE 4 GREAT EARTHQUAKESoccurs.  Armageddon will now be ready to explode.  The mountains begin to move.  Volcanoes begin to pour out smoke and ash.  There will be lightnings, voices, thunderings, and great hail.It could simply be said Jesus comes back to the earth.  The battle lasts 24 hours, few people are left alive, and then it is over.It is written: The heavens will roll together as a scroll.  The great Day of the Lord is near.  Behold,the Day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and He shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.  Alas for the day!for the Day of the Lord is at hand.Satan will put thoughts into people\u2019s minds, and, as a result, man, in his pride, will believe he can fight against God, and win.There was silence in heaven.  It will be ABOUT THE SPACE OF (or what seemed like) HALF AN HOUR.  The Battle of Armageddon, at this time, is at hand.(Jesus\u2014The First Time)When Jesus came the first time, He came as a lamb to be slaughtered.  He was tortured.  His beard was ripped off His face.  He was marred worse than any man.  He was almost unrecognizable.  He suffered an agonizing death.  He did this to pay the price for the sin of every person that would repent and trust in Him as their only hope of salvation.When Jesus departed about 2000 years ago, two men stood by and said: YE MEN OF GALILEE, WHY STAND YE GAZING UP INTO HEAVEN?THIS SAME JESUS, WHICH IS TAKEN UP FROM YOU INTO HEAVEN,SHALLSOCOMEIN LIKE MANNERAS YE HAVE SEEN HIM GO INTO HEAVEN.(Jesus\u2014The Second  Time)Approximately 2000 years after He was crucified and rose from the dead\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jesus will return.  However, this time, He will return as the King of all kings and Lord of all lords.  He will return in power and great glory to a world that will be so full of sin, rebellion, violence, and hatred that words cannot adequately convey it.  \nSince that time, those that follow Christ have watched.  Titus 2:13\u2013Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\nThe world will reject the God of heaven for the Antichrist.  Technology and false knowledge had also replaced the God of heaven.\nEven communion reveals the coming of the Lord.  It is written in 1 Cor 11:26\u2013FOR AS OFTEN AS YE EAT THIS BREAD, AND DRINK THIS CUP, YE DO SHOW THE LORD\u2019S DEATH (TILL HE COME).The temple of God will open.Heaven opened.  His eyes will be like a flame of fire.  On His head will be many crowns.  He will be dressed with a robe dipped in blood.  On His robe and on His thigh, there will be the name written: KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.  Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God.The armies that were in heaven will follow Him also on WHITE HORSES.  Those that follow Jesus will be clothed in fine linen, clean and white.\u201cThe Battle of Armageddon\u201dRegarding Armageddon, there should be six parts.The firstis when Satan and his angels confront Jesus returning in the air.The secondis when the Antichrist and False Prophet are eliminated.The thirdpart is when Jesus arrives on the earth.  His feet stand upon the Mt. of Olives.The fourthpart is Jesus on Mt. Zion.  He defends Jerusalem.The fifthis Megiddo.The sixthand last part is the whole world.There are more verses of Scripture in the Bible regarding the Battle of Armageddon, than any other single event.(THE BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON, PART 1\u2014IN THE AIR)(Satan Overcome)Satan and his angels will meet the Lord in the air, but will be overcome.  He will be brought down to hell, to the depths of the pit.He will have a seal put upon him, so hecannot deceive the nations (or people) any longer.  From the fall of Adam and Eve until this point, there has never been a time when the human race was free from being bombarded with evil, deceptive, lustful, enticing thoughts that were put in their mind by the devil; but they never understood this.  Neither do the churches teach it.  A man might be angry with his children\u2014then, all of a sudden, the anger is gone, as Satan\u2019s power to deceive is eliminated.When Satan is in hell, those already there shall NARROWLY LOOK UPON him, AND say: IS THIS THE MAN THAT MADE THE EARTH TO TREMBLE, THAT DID SHAKE KINGDOMS; THAT MADE THE WORLD AS A WILDERNESS, AND DESTROYED THE CITIES THEREOF; THAT OPENED NOT THE HOUSE OF HIS PRISONERS?  As a result of Satan having that seal put upon him, a most incredible thing will happen.Suddenly, throughout the world, the multitude of wrong, evil, accusing, hateful, self\u2013reliant and self\u2013centered thoughts, everyone has had from their childhood, will be gone.  One moment the armies of the world are confident.  Then, all of a sudden, they see things as they really are.  Terror will fill their hearts.  The tamborines will stop.  The harps will go silent.  \nMinutes before, the armies were prepared to do battle.  Now, they are terrified.  They will have no leader to give them direction in their thoughts.And the great men, and the rich men, and the heads of armies, and the mighty men, plus both the free and slaves willHIDE THEMSELVESin the caves and in the rocks of the mountains in the area of Megiddo.They will want the rocks to fall on them and hide them from the wrath of Jesus Christ, as they will now know JESUS will soon appear.  They will say, \u201cWho is able to stand?\u201d(BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON, PART 2)(The Antichrist and False Prophet Are Destroyed)As Christ returns, the Antichrist will stand up against Jesus, but will be broken by spiritual power.  Jesus will consume him with the breath of His mouth.  The Antichrist will be destroyed with the brightness (or splendor, or glory) of the coming of the King of kings.  The Antichrist and False Prophetwill be cast alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.  They will go into perdition.  Once Satan, the Antichrist, and False Prophet are eliminated, the armies of the world in Israel will be in complete disarray.  They will be confused.  They will be terrified.Fear will grip the earth.  The power of Satan to blind people\u2019s minds will cease.  As already said, this has never happened since the fall of Adam and Eve.(BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON, PART 3)The Total Battle Lasts 24 Hours(The Mount of Olives First, Then Mt. Zion)The sun is darkened, the moon no longer will give her light.Then, the sign of the Son of man will appearall over the earth.Amazingly, somehow the people of the world will see THE SON OF MAN SITTING ON THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, AND (then)COMING IN THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN.  This will happen on the tenth day of the seventh month, according to the Jewish calendar.  This is usually in the month of September.  It will be the fulfillment of the Day of Atonement.  At the beginning of the day (which is the evening) Jesus should return.  The King of kings and Lord of lords will return with fire and clouds, in power and great glory.  Thousands upon thousands of His saints will be with Him.The Day of the Lord will be a day of darkness and not light.  It will be a day of gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness.  Jesus will make darkness His canopy.The saints that will be with Him will be called, and chosen, and faithful.  He will come with His chariots like a whirlwind.  As Jesus returns, lightnings willencircle and lighten the entire world.  Many all over the world will instantly be killed because of the lightnings.The people of the earth will see and be terrified.  Every eye will see Him.  Even those that had pierced Him, about 2000 years earlier, will see Him return.  He will come in flaming vengeance against those that know not God, and against those that do not obey the Gospel.Jesus has total power over all the forces of nature, including the wind, storms, lightnings, hailstones, and tidal waves.There will be much crying in Jerusalem and Megiddo.  He will silence the speech of the wicked.  The cursing of the name of the Lord ceases, for they that did such things will be perishing.  As already said: If Jesus had not returned at the exact time He does, no life would be left on planet earth.God did not spare Sodom and Gomorrah because of sin.  God will not spare the earth, during Armageddon, because of their sin.  And God will not spare you, because of your sins, if you do not repent.Zech 14:4\u20137\u2013AND HIS FEET SHALL STAND IN THAT DAY UPON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES, WHICH IS BEFORE JERUSALEM ON THE EAST, AND THE MOUNT OF OLIVES SHALL CLEAVE IN THE MIDST THEREOF TOWARD THE EAST AND TOWARD THE WEST, AND THERE SHALL BE A VERY GREAT VALLEY; AND HALF OF THE MOUNTAIN SHALL REMOVE TOWARD THE NORTH, AND HALF OF IT TOWARD THE SOUTH\u2026BUT IT SHALL COME TO PASS, THATAT EVENINGTIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT.(BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON, PART 4)(Mt. Zion)Then Jesus will come down to Mt. Zion, which is just southwest of the Old City in Jerusalem.  The people will look upon Jesus, Whom they had pierced.  They will cry bitterly, in the same way one cries over their firstborn son.  In that day, the weeping in Jerusalem will be great.The Lord saved the dwellings ofJudah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem\u2019s inhabitants would not be greater than that of Judah.  As birds flying, the Lord defended Jerusalem,  Passing over, He preserves it.  All that  choose to fight against Jerusalem are cut to pieces.  Their flesh will rot away, while they stand on their feet.  Their eyes will rot (or disintegrate) in their sockets, and their tongues will rot away in their mouth.In the Day of the Lord, the Lord's people will be strong.  Jerusalem will remain intact.  Judah also will fight at Jerusalem.  Then the battle at Judah and Jerusalem will be over.  The enemies of the Lord will be destroyed.(BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON, PART 5)(Meggiddo and Israel)Jesus saves Israel next.  The Day of the Lord will be very dreadful.  Who can endure it?The greatest weapons of mass destruction ever created by man will be in the Valley of Megiddo.As the morning comes, there will be a great people, both upon the mountains of Israel and the area stretching from the hill of Megiddo all the way to Bozrah, about 161 miles.  The kings of the earth are gathered.  The grapes (or people) of the earth will be cast into the \u201cgreat\u201d winepress of the wrath and fury of God.It is written: Rev 16:16\u201321\u2013AND HE GATHERED THEM TOGETHER INTO A PLACE CALLED IN THE HEBREW TONGUE ARMAGEDDON (or Har Megiddo).  This was also referred to as the great WINEPRESS.Note: MOUNT MEGIDDOis a tel, which is a hill with 26 layers of ruins from ancient cities.  Its height varies.  It is app. 115 feet high and covers app. 15 acres.  It sits on the edge of a vast plain, known as Esdraelon, or the Jezreel Valley.  This fertile farmland of northern Israel extends to the Jordan Valley and then curves southward.  The top of the hill is somewhat flat with excavations from various time periods, dating back thousands of years.  It provides an excellent view of the valley for a long distance.  The large valley will be filled with the armies of the world.  Hundreds of millions of soldiers will be there and cover an area of about 161 miles long, extending southward along the Jordan Valley to Bozrah.What happens next is almost indescribable.  The soldiers will be as fully ripened grapes ready to be crushed.  Then they will be crushed.  Their blood will come out.  There will be asea of blood(as the Bible describes) to the reins of the horses, as far as the eye can see, even about 161 miles.IN THAT DAY A MAN SHALL CAST HIS IDOLS OF SILVER, AND HIS IDOLS OF GOLD, WHICH THEY MADE EACH ONE FOR HIMSELF TO WORSHIP, TO THE MOLES AND TO THE BATS.Isa 2:21 NIV\u2013THEY WILLFLEE TOCAVERNS IN THE ROCKS AND TO THE OVERHANGING CRAGS FROM DREAD OF THE LORD.Jesus had said: I HAVE TRODDEN THE WINEPRESS ALONE; AND OF THE PEOPLE THERE WAS NONE WITH ME: FOR I WILL TREAD THEM IN MINE ANGER, AND TRAMPLE THEM IN MY FURY; AND THEIR BLOOD SHALL BE SPRINKLED UPON MY GARMENTS.Rev 14:20\u2013AND THEWINEPRESSWAS (trampled) (outside) THE CITY (which is, Jerusalem),AND BLOOD(flowed)OUT OF THE WINEPRESS, (rising)EVEN UNTO(or as high as)THE HORSE BRIDLES, BY THE SPACE OF A THOUSAND AND SIX HUNDRED FURLONGS (or approximately 161 miles or longer).It is written: Rev 15:4\u2013WHO SHALL NOT FEAR THEE, O LORD?The noise of the lightnings, and thunderings, and of the earth quaking will be so loud, that the screams of the millions dying may not be heard.  Then, the huge hailstones also begin to fall.  Each should weigh 70 to 100 pounds.Nothing will be able to deliver the multitude of the unrighteous in the Day of the Lord.  Sin will be removed from the land in one day.  Everything will be brought low.Fire will go before Jesus.  It will burn up His enemies on every side.People will be screaming for fear, hoping they might some how be hid from Christ, and from His anger and fury.  The mountains will melt like wax before the Lord.(THE FOURTH AND LAST OF THE 4 GREAT EARTHQUAKES)Then the fourth AND LAST of the great earthquakes occurs.  This will be the greatest since mankind has existed.  It will come to pass during the Battle of Armageddon.  The great city of Jerusalem will be divided into three parts.  It will be world wide.  The earth shall shake and be transformed.  (This should be covered in more detail under the heading of Armageddon worldwide.)Finally, the battle for Israel will be over.  Hundreds of millions will be dead.  Few will be left alive, except those God had chosen to repopulate the earth during the Millennium.Two\u2013thirds of the Jewish people will be cut off and die.One\u2013thirdwill be protected by God and go into the Millennium.  So it is that all Israel shall be saved.The birds will be summoned to the supper of the great God.  They will eat the flesh of kings, and generals, and of captains.  They will eat the flesh of all that are dead.(THE GREAT BATTLE OF THE LORD IS WORLDWIDE, Part 6)(The Battle of Armageddon and the Entire Planet)The last part of the battle includes the entire earth.  But in that day, the Lord will hold up the right hand of those that are His, that is, those that had not taken the mark and worshipped the image.  He will help and protect them.The oceans will be the buriel ground for those that are in ships and submarines.When Jesus speaks, things come to pass.  The entire planet will be like a winepress, and the people like grapes that are ripe for the harvest.  Throughout the earth, the noise will be loud and terrifying.(Fire)*  With fire, the earth and people will be burned.The Lord with flaming fire will take vengeance on those that do not obey the Gospel.  He comes with flames of fire.  He will utter His Word.  He speaks, and fire goes forth before Him.  He will rain fire and brimstone on the wicked.  He will judge the earth.  His enemies are burned. His tongue will be as a devouring fire.  His fury will be poured out like fire.   The foundations of the mountains will be on fire.  The mountains will quake, and the hills melt; and the rocks will be thrown down.  All the earth will be devoured with thefireof His jealousy.  People are consumed, but they do not take it to heart.  The earth is being cleansed.  Who can endure the fierceness of His anger?Whirlwinds will also arise from the coasts.  There will be hurricanes, tornadoes, monsoons, cyclones, and every form of windstorm known.  They will explode upon the scene and upon the heads of the wicked.There will be huge hailstones, lightnings and thunders.  Great clouds and darkness will be everywhere.  Great cracks in the earth will open up and swallow everything in their path.  Huge waves from the oceans will drive inland for long distances, obliterating everything in their path.  The destruction will be catastrophic!Jesus will thrust in His sickle.  The earth is reaped or harvested.  From one end of the earth to the other, the people are cut down.  The King of kings and Lord of lords will make an end of all places where the Hebrews had been taken.Then, it happens.THE FOURTH AND LAST OF THE 4 GREAT EARTHQUAKES.  This will be the greatest since mankind has existed.  It will come to pass during the Battle of Armageddon.  The entire earth will shake.  All mountains will be made low.  They will be swallowed up.  The great mountain ranges will cease to exist.  The valleys will rise, and few people will be left alive.  Then the earth will move out of her place and turn upside down.  There are no adequate words to describe it.  Who is it that says they will not fear the Lord?  People will try to hide, but there is no where to hide, or no place of safety.  Hiding places will become coffins.  The cities of the world will disappear.In that day,the earth will be moved exceedingly, and the light of the moon will be much brighter.  The light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days.THE BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON IS OVER*  God\u2019s enemies submit.In that day, only Jesus Christ is exalted.The people that survive will move out of their holes like worms.  They will greatly fear.The birds will be called to gather, from around the world, to eat the flesh of the dead bodies.  However, many of the dead will be swallowed up by the earthquake.(The Results)The kingdom of the Antichrist will not be found.The earth will be at rest.The earth will be at peace.The earth will be cleansed.  Fire purifies.The pride of man will be gone.  It will cease.Upon every high hill, there will be rivers and streams of water.There will be no trace of all the previous kingdoms.(The Eastern Gate)The eastern side of the gate had been sealed.The western side had not.  Inside of the gate is a large room, which had been used at times by the Arabs as a classroom.When Jesus returns, He will enter the Temple Mount through the East Gate.The earth will shine with His glory.Oh, that man could understand these things before they happen, and before they perish; but they will not fear the Lord.(THE JUDGMENT OF THE NATIONS\u2013ref Mt 25:31\u201346)The ELECT will be gathered.Those left alive will be gathered and judged.Those that followed Christ will be on the right, and those that took the mark and worshipped the Antichrist will be on the left at the Judgment of the Nations.  Those on the left will be cast into the lake of fire.THIS GENERATION (The Generation of the Rebirth of Israel) PASSED AWAYIt is written, Lk 21:32\u2013VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU, THIS GENERATION SHALL NOT PASS AWAY, TILL ALL BE FULFILLED.When Israel was reborn on May 14th, 1948, the generation of the fig tree began.This generation that began with Israel\u2019s rebirth will not pass away, until Armageddon is over, and the elect are gathered.The Scriptures say in Ps 90:10\u2013THE DAYS OF OUR YEARS ARE THREESCORE YEARS AND TEN (or 70 years); AND IF BY REASON OF STRENGTH THEY BE FOURSCORE YEARS (or 80), YET IS THEIR STRENGTH LABOUR AND SORROW; FOR IT IS SOON CUT OFF, AND WE FLY AWAY.Here is even more proof that cannot be denied.  It is written: When thou art inTribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, evenin the latter days\u2013ref Deut 4:30.  Israel\u2019s rebirth was the beginning of the latter days\u2014May 14, 1948.  The period from this event to Jesus\u2019 return should not exceed a generation (70 to 80 years).  The verse just stated the Tribulation is also in the latter days.  Thus, we believe, the Tribulation should be complete before 80 years expires.  It will be soon.\n\n2 Cor 5:11\u2013KNOWING THEREFORE THE TERROR OF THE LORD, WE PERSUADE MEN.(THE 1000 YEAR REIGN OF JESUS CHRIST)The seventh and last feast is theFeast of Tabernacles.  This begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month for seven days.  This represents the beginning of the comingstate of rest called the Millennium.  Jesus Christ begins His reign on earth for one thousand years, as the King of kings and Lord of lords.  The tabernacle of Jesus will be among men.  (Again, this event will be fulfilled exactly on the correct day.)The twelve apostles will reign over the twelve tribes of Israel.  The world will be at peace.  The world will love the Jews.All that return with Jesus will also reign and rule.  Some will be over tens, some over hundreds, some over thousands, some over cities.ARE YOU READY TO MEET JESUS?We have proven the Bible is God\u2019s Word.  Now you are faced with a decision.  You may say, \u201cMy church doesn\u2019t believe this.\u201d  You must decide. Will you believe God\u2019s Word (the Bible), or what your church teaches, or what other people may say?WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE SAVED? FOUR THINGS.1.  Admit that you are a sinner. The Bible tells us, ALL HAVE SINNED AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH.2.  Be willing to change, forsake all sin, humble yourself and live for Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0094REPENT.  God will help you.  It is written, EXCEPT YE REPENT, YE SHALL ALL LIKEWISE PERISH.  Jesus tells us, HE THAT IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME.3.  Believe in your heart Jesus Christ is God\u2019s only begotten Son, Who came to this earth in the flesh, in human form.  Believe He died for your sins.  It is written, THERE IS NONE OTHER NAME UNDER HEAVEN GIVEN AMONG MEN, WHEREBY WE MUST BE SAVED.4.  Ask for forgiveness. Ask for God\u2019s mercy.By faith, receive Jesus Christ as your only hope of salvation.  I am going to ask you to make that decision for Jesus right now.  Please kneel right where you are.  God may be calling you.  Don\u2019t resist. The Bible tells us, THERE IS A WAY WHICH SEEMETH RIGHT UNTO A MAN, BUT THE END THEREOF ARE THE WAYS OF DEATH.  It\u2019s not a matter of if you think you know Jesus,but does Jesus know you?  Right now, humble yourself, kneel and pray this prayer out loud and mean it.DEAR JESUS, I AM A SINNER.  I BELIEVE YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD AND DIED FOR MY SINS ON THE CROSS. FORGIVE ALL OF MY SINS.  JESUS, I REPENT.  HAVE MERCY ON ME, A SINNER AND COME INTO MY LIFE. HELP ME TO FOLLOW AND OBEY YOUR WORD (THE BIBLE).  I ASK IT IN THE NAME OF MY LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.IF YOU JUST SAID THAT PRAYER AND MEANT IT WITH ALL YOUR HEARTIf you repented and asked Jesus to be your Lord and Savior, pleaseEMAIL USimmediately.  We would like to pray for you. If you do not receive a reply from us within 2 weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0094email us again.  There have been some problems with some emails getting through.Now, you need to begin reading your Bibleevery dayfaithfully\u20145 ormorechapters.  Start with the Gospel of John.  Read it through three times.  Next go to Matthew, andread the New Testament three times.  Then read the entire Bible in order, from Genesis to the Revelation.  Be a doer of the Word and not a hearer only, deceiving yourself\u00e2\u0080\u0093ref Ja 1:22.Find a good, Bible\u00e2\u0080\u0093teaching church that believes God\u2019s Word and baptizes by full immersion.  They should also love Israel and the Jewish people.  Don\u2019t be trapped by reading things \u201cabout\u201d the Bible.  Read \u201cthe Bible,\u201d which is God\u2019s Word.  Yes, there will be many things you will not understand at first.  But if you are faithful in reading God\u2019s Word that will change.Don\u2019t get distracted with this or that Bible studyin the beginning.  As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby\u20131 Pe 2:2.BEBAPTIZEDBY FULL IMMERSIONIN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, AND OF THE SON, AND OF THE HOLY GHOST\u00e2\u0080\u0093Col 2:12; Mt 28:19; Ro chapter 6.  Tell others that Jesus is your only hope of salvation.  Never be ashamed of Jesus in any way, even when it comes to praying over your meals.  Sprinkling and infant baptism means nothing.  Any baptism done prior to repenting and believing in Jesus Christ is NO BAPTISM AT ALL\u00e2\u0080\u0093ref Acts 2:38; Ro 6:1\u00e2\u0080\u009310; Col 2:12; Mt 28:19.A big mistake many make is they do not immerse themselves in God\u2019s Word.  They say they want to follow Jesus, but they do not read and study His Word.To follow Jesus is to read, follow, and obey the words of Jesus.  Many chapters should be read every day faithfully.  A person that does not read God\u2019s Word faithfully, is usually a person that had not repented.  To love Jesus is to love and obey His Word.If you decided to put off surrendering to Jesus, consider this.  There was a certain man who said to his preacher, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I will come to Jesus in the 11th hour.\u201d  Time after time, he would come to his preacher and repeat these words.  Then one day, he did it again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.  In the 11th hour, I will surrender to Jesus.\u201d  Then the man left the preacher\u2019s office.  Shortly after, the preacher heard a terrible crash.  He ran outside and found the man lying dead in the street after being hit by a car.  A person said to the preacher, \u201cHe didn't know this day was his 11th hour.\u201d  If you have read this far, chances are good God is calling you.  Beware of thoughts in your head from the devil, saying, \u201cYou cannot be saved, because of\u2026this or that,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re just no good.\u201d  The blood of Christ is greater than all your sins.ALL SCRIPTURE IS GIVEN BY INSPIRATION OF GOD, AND IS PROFITABLE FOR DOCTRINE, FOR REPROOF, FOR CORRECTION, FOR INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS\u20132 Tim 3:16.Heb 10:31\u2013IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD.\u201cWILL I GO TO HEAVEN?\u201dMany are positive they will go to heaven when they die.  Many are positive they will be raptured when that occurs.  However, the Bible states clearly (of that number that believe they are saved) only a few, a very few really are saved by the grace of God.We are currently living in the Laodicean church age\u2013Rev 3:14\u201321.  This is the church age that will witness the Rapture, but all lukewarm Christians will be left behind.  Their spiritual condition is wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked.  In nearly every case, this describes your church and probably you.  At best, you are probably lukewarm.Want proof?Mt 7:21  Many Think They Are Saved, But Are NotNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord (or thinks they are saved), shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; buthe that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven\u2013Mt 7:21.The will of God is that a personrepents, and then follows repentance withwater baptismby full immersion.  As it is written, REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED EVERYONE\u2013Acts 2:38.  The will of God is that a person diligentlystudies the Bible\u2013Mt 11:29, and then afterwardobeys it.  It is written: He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him\u2013Heb 5:9.  And hereby we do know that we know him, if wekeep his commandments\u20131 Jn 2:3.The will of God is that youserve God.  As it is written, Mal 3:18\u2013Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, betweenhim that serveth Godand him that serveth him not.  Lk 4:8\u2013Jesus\u2026said\u2026Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, andhim only shalt thou serve.These accepted Jesus as their Savior, but perished, as theydid not do the will of God.But few will do this.Mt 7:22,23\u2013Manywill say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  These accepted Jesus as their Savior.  These also served God; however, theydid not repentas is required.  They perished.Mt 25:1\u201313  Many Think They Are Saved, But Are NotMt 25:1\u201313\u2013reveals ten Christians.  Five were wise.  Five were foolish.  They were all waiting for the Rapture.  Then at midnight (Israeli time), a cry was made BEHOLD THE BRIDEGROOM COMETH.  GO YE OUT TO MEET HIM.When Jesus returned to rapture the born again Christians, the five that had their light still burning were taken.However the other five had let their light for Christ go out.  They were not taken.  These foolish Christians had stopped following Christ.  They sought Jesus to open for them, but Jesus told them, I KNOW YOU NOT.God\u2019s warning to all that belong to Him is this.  Obey God, follow Him, and watch for His soon return.  Following Jesus and obeying His Word is required.Lk 6:46\u201349  Many Think They Are Saved, But Are NotJesus asked the question: And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?  Why do people think they are saved, when they will not study and obey the Gospel.Lk 6:46\u201349  Study and Obey God's Word.  The Only Foundation That Will StandLk 6:47,48\u2013Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them,\u2026He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.  Lk 6:49\u2013But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.  A person that does not build upon God\u2019s Word, when the difficulties arise, they will crumble.Lk 13:23\u201328Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved?  And he said unto them, Strive (or work hard) to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.  Many will perish.  Note, many will perish.When once the master of the house (which is Jesus) is risen up, and hath shut to the door (meaning when the Rapture has occurred and it is over), and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying,Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are.  Note those left behind call Jesus their Lord.  They were positive they were saved, yet were left behind.  Then they begin to make excuses.  Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.  But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.  These had called on Jesus to be their Savior, but they had not repented.  They had not given up all their sins.  They had not followed Jesus as is required.  They had not devoured God\u2019s Word and obeyed it.  There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.Will you go to heaven?  You must repent, and not go back.You are commanded to be baptized by full immersion afterward.  You are to repent and be baptized EVERYONE.Then you need to begin to devour God\u2019s Word, as if it is more necessary than your necessary food.  As you do this, your faith should grow; and by faith, a person overcomes this present world. Then you are to obey God's Word.  You are to deny yourself and pick up your cross and follow Jesus.  You are to die to yourself daily.  Jesus is to be not only your Savior, but also your Lord and King.  Do these things, and you shall live.  Compromise, and you may expect to perish.CLOSING1 Jn 2:15\u201317\u2013Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.List of all 365 prophecies\u2013CLICK HEREValley of Megiddo where Armageddon will take place.TOP", "(Jesus\u2014The First Time)", "When Jesus came the first time, He came as a lamb to be slaughtered.  He was tortured.  His beard was ripped off His face.  He was marred worse than any man.  He was almost unrecognizable.  He suffered an agonizing death.  He did this to pay the price for the sin of every person that would repent and trust in Him as their only hope of salvation.When Jesus departed about 2000 years ago, two men stood by and said: YE MEN OF GALILEE, WHY STAND YE GAZING UP INTO HEAVEN?THIS SAME JESUS, WHICH IS TAKEN UP FROM YOU INTO HEAVEN,SHALLSOCOMEIN LIKE MANNERAS YE HAVE SEEN HIM GO INTO HEAVEN.", "(Jesus\u2014The Second  Time)", "Approximately 2000 years after He was crucified and rose from the dead\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jesus will return.  However, this time, He will return as the King of all kings and Lord of all lords.  He will return in power and great glory to a world that will be so full of sin, rebellion, violence, and hatred that words cannot adequately convey it.  \nSince that time, those that follow Christ have watched.  Titus 2:13\u2013Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\nThe world will reject the God of heaven for the Antichrist.

His eyes will be like a flame of fire.  On His head will be many crowns.  He will be dressed with a robe dipped in blood.  On His robe and on His thigh, there will be the name written: KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

His feet stand upon the Mt. of Olives.The fourthpart is Jesus on Mt. Zion.

He will be brought down to hell, to the depths of the pit.He will have a seal put upon him, so hecannot deceive the nations (or people) any longer.  From the fall of Adam and Eve until this point, there has never been a time when the human race was free from being bombarded with evil, deceptive, lustful, enticing thoughts that were put in their mind by the devil; but they never understood this.  Neither do the churches teach it.  A man might be angry with his children\u2014then, all of a sudden, the anger is gone, as Satan\u2019s power to deceive is eliminated.When Satan is in hell, those already there shall NARROWLY LOOK UPON him, AND say: IS THIS THE MAN THAT MADE THE EARTH TO TREMBLE, THAT DID SHAKE KINGDOMS; THAT MADE THE WORLD AS A WILDERNESS, AND DESTROYED THE CITIES THEREOF; THAT OPENED NOT THE HOUSE OF HIS PRISONERS?  As a result of Satan having that seal put upon him, a most incredible thing will happen.Suddenly, throughout the world, the multitude of wrong, evil, accusing, hateful, self\u2013reliant and self\u2013centered thoughts, everyone has had from their childhood, will be gone.  One moment the armies of the world are confident.  Then, all of a sudden, they see things as they really are.  Terror will fill their hearts.  The tamborines will stop.  The harps will go silent.  \nMinutes before, the armies were prepared to do battle.  Now, they are terrified.  They will have no leader to give them direction in their thoughts.And the great men, and the rich men, and the heads of armies, and the mighty men, plus both the free and slaves willHIDE THEMSELVESin the caves and in the rocks of the mountains in the area of Megiddo.They will want the rocks to fall on them and hide them from the wrath of Jesus Christ, as they will now know JESUS will soon appear.

Jesus will consume him with the breath of His mouth.  The Antichrist will be destroyed with the brightness (or splendor, or glory) of the coming of the King of kings.  The Antichrist and False Prophetwill be cast alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.  They will go into perdition.  Once Satan, the Antichrist, and False Prophet are eliminated, the armies of the world in Israel will be in complete disarray.  They will be confused.

This will happen on the tenth day of the seventh month, according to the Jewish calendar.  This is usually in the month of September.  It will be the fulfillment of the Day of Atonement.  At the beginning of the day (which is the evening) Jesus should return.  The King of kings and Lord of lords will return with fire and clouds, in power and great glory.  Thousands upon thousands of His saints will be with Him.The Day of the Lord will be a day of darkness and not light.  It will be a day of gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness.  Jesus will make darkness His canopy.The saints that will be with Him will be called, and chosen, and faithful.  He will come with His chariots like a whirlwind.  As Jesus returns, lightnings willencircle and lighten the entire world.  Many all over the world will instantly be killed because of the lightnings.The people of the earth will see and be terrified.  Every eye will see Him.  Even those that had pierced Him, about 2000 years earlier, will see Him return.  He will come in flaming vengeance against those that know not God, and against those that do not obey the Gospel.Jesus has total power over all the forces of nature, including the wind, storms, lightnings, hailstones, and tidal waves.There will be much crying in Jerusalem and Megiddo.  He will silence the speech of the wicked.  The cursing of the name of the Lord ceases, for they that did such things will be perishing.  As already said: If Jesus had not returned at the exact time He does, no life would be left on planet earth.God did not spare Sodom and Gomorrah because of sin.  God will not spare the earth, during Armageddon, because of their sin.  And God will not spare you, because of your sins, if you do not repent.Zech 14:4\u20137\u2013AND HIS FEET SHALL STAND IN THAT DAY UPON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES, WHICH IS BEFORE JERUSALEM ON THE EAST, AND THE MOUNT OF OLIVES SHALL CLEAVE IN THE MIDST THEREOF TOWARD THE EAST AND TOWARD THE WEST, AND THERE SHALL BE A VERY GREAT VALLEY; AND HALF OF THE MOUNTAIN SHALL REMOVE TOWARD THE NORTH, AND HALF OF IT TOWARD THE SOUTH\u2026BUT IT SHALL COME TO PASS, THATAT EVENINGTIME IT SHALL BE LIGHT.", "(BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON, PART 4)(Mt.

They will cry bitterly, in the same way one cries over their firstborn son.  In that day, the weeping in Jerusalem will be great.The Lord saved the dwellings ofJudah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem\u2019s inhabitants would not be greater than that of Judah.  As birds flying, the Lord defended Jerusalem,  Passing over, He preserves it.  All that  choose to fight against Jerusalem are cut to pieces.  Their flesh will rot away, while they stand on their feet.  Their eyes will rot (or disintegrate) in their sockets, and their tongues will rot away in their mouth.In the Day of the Lord, the Lord's people will be strong.  Jerusalem will remain intact.  Judah also will fight at Jerusalem.  Then the battle at Judah and Jerusalem will be over.  The enemies of the Lord will be destroyed.", "(BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON, PART 5)(Meggiddo and Israel)", "Jesus saves Israel next.  The Day of the Lord will be very dreadful.  Who can endure it?The greatest weapons of mass destruction ever created by man will be in the Valley of Megiddo.As the morning comes, there will be a great people, both upon the mountains of Israel and the area stretching from the hill of Megiddo all the way to Bozrah, about 161 miles.  The kings of the earth are gathered.  The grapes (or people) of the earth will be cast into the \u201cgreat\u201d winepress of the wrath and fury of God.It is written: Rev 16:16\u201321\u2013AND HE GATHERED THEM TOGETHER INTO A PLACE CALLED IN THE HEBREW TONGUE ARMAGEDDON (or Har Megiddo).  This was also referred to as the great WINEPRESS.Note: MOUNT MEGIDDOis a tel, which is a hill with 26 layers of ruins from ancient cities.  Its height varies.  It is app. 115 feet high and covers app. 15 acres.  It sits on the edge of a vast plain, known as Esdraelon, or the Jezreel Valley.  This fertile farmland of northern Israel extends to the Jordan Valley and then curves southward.  The top of the hill is somewhat flat with excavations from various time periods, dating back thousands of years.  It provides an excellent view of the valley for a long distance.  The large valley will be filled with the armies of the world.  Hundreds of millions of soldiers will be there and cover an area of about 161 miles long, extending southward along the Jordan Valley to Bozrah.What happens next is almost indescribable.  The soldiers will be as fully ripened grapes ready to be crushed.  Then they will be crushed.  Their blood will come out.  There will be asea of blood(as the Bible describes) to the reins of the horses, as far as the eye can see, even about 161 miles.IN THAT DAY A MAN SHALL CAST HIS IDOLS OF SILVER, AND HIS IDOLS OF GOLD, WHICH THEY MADE EACH ONE FOR HIMSELF TO WORSHIP, TO THE MOLES AND TO THE BATS.Isa 2:21 NIV\u2013THEY WILLFLEE TOCAVERNS IN THE ROCKS AND TO THE OVERHANGING CRAGS FROM DREAD OF THE LORD.Jesus had said: I HAVE TRODDEN THE WINEPRESS ALONE; AND OF THE PEOPLE THERE WAS NONE WITH ME: FOR I WILL TREAD THEM IN MINE ANGER, AND TRAMPLE THEM IN MY FURY; AND THEIR BLOOD SHALL BE SPRINKLED UPON MY GARMENTS.Rev 14:20\u2013AND THEWINEPRESSWAS (trampled) (outside) THE CITY (which is, Jerusalem),AND BLOOD(flowed)OUT OF THE WINEPRESS, (rising)EVEN UNTO(or as high as)THE HORSE BRIDLES, BY THE SPACE OF A THOUSAND AND SIX HUNDRED FURLONGS (or approximately 161 miles or longer).It is written: Rev 15:4\u2013WHO SHALL NOT FEAR THEE, O LORD?The noise of the lightnings, and thunderings, and of the earth quaking will be so loud, that the screams of the millions dying may not be heard.  Then, the huge hailstones also begin to fall.  Each should weigh 70 to 100 pounds.Nothing will be able to deliver the multitude of the unrighteous in the Day of the Lord.  Sin will be removed from the land in one day.  Everything will be brought low.Fire will go before Jesus.  It will burn up His enemies on every side.People will be screaming for fear, hoping they might some how be hid from Christ, and from His anger and fury.  The mountains will melt like wax before the Lord.", "(THE FOURTH AND LAST OF THE 4 GREAT EARTHQUAKES)", "Then the fourth AND LAST of the great earthquakes occurs.  This will be the greatest since mankind has existed.  It will come to pass during the Battle of Armageddon.  The great city of Jerusalem will be divided into three parts.  It will be world wide.  The earth shall shake and be transformed.  (This should be covered in more detail under the heading of Armageddon worldwide.)Finally, the battle for Israel will be over.  Hundreds of millions will be dead.  Few will be left alive, except those God had chosen to repopulate the earth during the Millennium.Two\u2013thirds of the Jewish people will be cut off and die.One\u2013thirdwill be protected by God and go into the Millennium.

Throughout the earth, the noise will be loud and terrifying.", "(Fire)", "*  With fire, the earth and people will be burned.The Lord with flaming fire will take vengeance on those that do not obey the Gospel.  He comes with flames of fire.  He will utter His Word.  He speaks, and fire goes forth before Him.  He will rain fire and brimstone on the wicked.  He will judge the earth.  His enemies are burned. His tongue will be as a devouring fire.  His fury will be poured out like fire.   The foundations of the mountains will be on fire.  The mountains will quake, and the hills melt; and the rocks will be thrown down.  All the earth will be devoured with thefireof His jealousy.  People are consumed, but they do not take it to heart.  The earth is being cleansed.  Who can endure the fierceness of His anger?Whirlwinds will also arise from the coasts.  There will be hurricanes, tornadoes, monsoons, cyclones, and every form of windstorm known.  They will explode upon the scene and upon the heads of the wicked.There will be huge hailstones, lightnings and thunders.  Great clouds and darkness will be everywhere.  Great cracks in the earth will open up and swallow everything in their path.  Huge waves from the oceans will drive inland for long distances, obliterating everything in their path.  The destruction will be catastrophic!Jesus will thrust in His sickle.  The earth is reaped or harvested.  From one end of the earth to the other, the people are cut down.  The King of kings and Lord of lords will make an end of all places where the Hebrews had been taken.Then, it happens.THE FOURTH AND LAST OF THE 4 GREAT EARTHQUAKES.  This will be the greatest since mankind has existed.  It will come to pass during the Battle of Armageddon.  The entire earth will shake.  All mountains will be made low.  They will be swallowed up.  The great mountain ranges will cease to exist.  The valleys will rise, and few people will be left alive.  Then the earth will move out of her place and turn upside down.  There are no adequate words to describe it.  Who is it that says they will not fear the Lord?  People will try to hide, but there is no where to hide, or no place of safety.  Hiding places will become coffins.  The cities of the world will disappear.In that day,the earth will be moved exceedingly, and the light of the moon will be much brighter.

It is written: When thou art inTribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, evenin the latter days\u2013ref Deut 4:30.  Israel\u2019s rebirth was the beginning of the latter days\u2014May 14, 1948.  The period from this event to Jesus\u2019 return should not exceed a generation (70 to 80 years).

Yes, there will be many things you will not understand at first.

Tell others that Jesus is your only hope of salvation.  Never be ashamed of Jesus in any way, even when it comes to praying over your meals.  Sprinkling and infant baptism means nothing.  Any baptism done prior to repenting and believing in Jesus Christ is NO BAPTISM AT ALL\u00e2\u0080\u0093ref Acts 2:38; Ro 6:1\u00e2\u0080\u009310; Col 2:12; Mt 28:19.A big mistake many make is they do not immerse themselves in God\u2019s Word.  They say they want to follow Jesus, but they do not read and study His Word.To follow Jesus is to read, follow, and obey the words of Jesus.  Many chapters should be read every day faithfully.  A person that does not read God\u2019s Word faithfully, is usually a person that had not repented.  To love Jesus is to love and obey His Word.If you decided to put off surrendering to Jesus, consider this.  There was a certain man who said to his preacher, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I will come to Jesus in the 11th hour.\u201d  Time after time, he would come to his preacher and repeat these words.  Then one day, he did it again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.  In the 11th hour, I will surrender to Jesus.\u201d  Then the man left the preacher\u2019s office.  Shortly after, the preacher heard a terrible crash.  He ran outside and found the man lying dead in the street after being hit by a car.  A person said to the preacher, \u201cHe didn't know this day was his 11th hour.\u201d  If you have read this far, chances are good God is calling you.  Beware of thoughts in your head from the devil, saying, \u201cYou cannot be saved, because of\u2026this or that,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re just no good.\u201d  The blood of Christ is greater than all your sins.ALL SCRIPTURE IS GIVEN BY INSPIRATION OF GOD, AND IS PROFITABLE FOR DOCTRINE, FOR REPROOF, FOR CORRECTION, FOR INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS\u20132 Tim 3:16.Heb 10:31\u2013IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD.", "\u201cWILL I GO TO HEAVEN?\u201d", "Many are positive they will go to heaven when they die.

This is the church age that will witness the Rapture, but all lukewarm Christians will be left behind.  Their spiritual condition is wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked.

They had not given up all their sins.  They had not followed Jesus as is required.  They had not devoured God\u2019s Word and obeyed it.

As you do this, your faith should grow; and by faith, a person overcomes this present world. Then you are to obey God's Word.  You are to deny yourself and pick up your cross and follow Jesus.
